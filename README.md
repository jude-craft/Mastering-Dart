## 📚 What's Covered

### 1. Variables and Data Types
Learn how to declare and use variables in Dart:
- **`var`** - Type inference (Dart figures out the type)
- **`String`, `int`, `double`, `bool`** - Explicit types
- **`dynamic`** - Variables that can change type (use sparingly!)
- **`final`** - Runtime constants (set once, can't change)
- **`const`** - Compile-time constants (immutable)

**Why it matters for Flutter**: Flutter widgets use `final` extensively. Understanding immutability is crucial for performance.

### 2. String Operations
Master string manipulation:
- String interpolation (`$variable` and `${expression}`)
- Multi-line strings
- Common methods (toUpperCase, toLowerCase, contains, replaceAll)
- Raw strings for paths

**Why it matters for Flutter**: You'll constantly work with text in UI elements, API responses, and user input.

### 3. Collections (List, Set, Map)
The three essential data structures:

#### List
- Ordered collection (maintains insertion order)
- Allows duplicates
- Access by index
```dart
var fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange'];
```

#### Set
- Unordered collection
- No duplicates (automatically removes them)
- Fast membership testing
```dart
var uniqueNumbers = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4}; // {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

#### Map
- Key-value pairs (like dictionaries or objects)
- Fast lookup by key
```dart
var scores = {'Alice': 95, 'Bob': 87};
```

**Why it matters for Flutter**: Lists are everywhere (ListView, GridView), Maps are used for JSON data, Sets for unique items.

### 4. Functions
Everything about functions in Dart:
- Basic functions with return types
- Arrow functions (`=>`) for single expressions
- Optional positional parameters `[int? age]`
- Named parameters `{required String name, int age = 0}`
- Functions as parameters (callbacks)
- Anonymous functions

**Why it matters for Flutter**: Flutter is heavily callback-based. Widget builders, event handlers, and navigation all use functions.

### 5. Control Flow
Decision-making and loops:
- **if-else** statements for conditions
- **Ternary operator** (`condition ? true : false`)
- **Switch statements** for multiple conditions
- **for loops** - traditional counting
- **for-in loops** - iterating collections
- **while & do-while loops**

**Why it matters for Flutter**: You'll use these to conditionally render widgets, process lists, and handle user interactions.

### 6. Object-Oriented Programming
The foundation of Flutter development:

#### Classes
- Properties (data)
- Constructors (how to create objects)
- Methods (behavior)
```dart
class Person {
  String name;
  int age;
  
  Person(this.name, this.age);
  
  void greet() => print('Hello, I am $name');
}
```

#### Inheritance
- Extending classes with `extends`
- Overriding methods with `@override`
- Using `super` to call parent class

#### Abstract Classes
- Cannot be instantiated directly
- Define contracts for subclasses
- Mix abstract and concrete methods

#### Getters and Setters
- Computed properties
- Validation on setting values
- Private properties (prefix with `_`)

**Why it matters for Flutter**: EVERYTHING in Flutter is a class! Widgets, State, Controllers - understanding OOP is essential.

### 7. Null Safety
Dart's killer feature for preventing null errors:

#### Non-nullable by default
```dart
String name = 'John';  // Cannot be null
// name = null;        // Error!
```

#### Nullable types
```dart
String? name;  // Can be null
name = null;   // OK
```

#### Null-aware operators
- **`??`** - Provide default if null: `name ?? 'Guest'`
- **`?.`** - Safe property access: `name?.length`
- **`!`** - Assert non-null (use carefully!): `name!.toUpperCase()`
- **`??=`** - Assign if null: `name ??= 'Default'`

#### Late initialization
```dart
late String description;  // Will be initialized before use
```

**Why it matters for Flutter**: Prevents null reference errors, makes code safer, and is mandatory in modern Dart/Flutter.

### 8. Async Programming
Essential for network calls and time-consuming operations:

#### Future
Represents a value that will be available in the future:
```dart
Future<String> fetchData() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 2));
  return 'Data loaded';
}
```

#### async/await
Clean syntax for handling asynchronous code:
```dart
Future<void> loadData() async {
  var data = await fetchData();
  print(data);  // Waits for fetchData to complete
}
```

**Why it matters for Flutter**: Critical for API calls, database queries, file I/O, and any operation that takes time. Flutter apps are asynchronous by nature.

### 9. Error Handling
Gracefully handling errors:
- **try-catch** blocks
- **finally** for cleanup code
- **throw** to raise exceptions
- Catching specific exception types

**Why it matters for Flutter**: Network failures, invalid user input, file operations - you need to handle errors gracefully for good UX.

### 10. Extensions and Mixins

#### Extensions
Add methods to existing types:
```dart
extension StringExtension on String {
  String capitalize() => /* implementation */;
}

'hello'.capitalize();  // 'Hello'
```

#### Mixins
Share behavior across multiple classes:
```dart
mixin Performer {
  void perform() => print('Performing...');
}

class Musician with Performer {}
```

**Why it matters for Flutter**: Extensions make code more readable, mixins enable code reuse without complex inheritance.

## 🔑 Key Concepts Explained

### Immutability
Flutter favors immutable objects for performance:
```dart
final list = [1, 2, 3];  // Can't reassign list
list.add(4);             // But can modify contents

const list2 = [1, 2, 3]; // Deeply immutable
// list2.add(4);          // Error!
```

### Type Inference
Dart is smart about types:
```dart
var name = 'John';    // Dart knows it's a String
var age = 25;         // Dart knows it's an int
```

### Named Parameters
Make function calls self-documenting:
```dart
// Instead of:
createUser('John', 25, 'Nairobi');  // What is each parameter?

// Use:
createUser(
  name: 'John',
  age: 25,
  city: 'Nairobi'
);  // Crystal clear!
```

### Cascade Notation
Chain operations on the same object:
```dart
var person = Person()
  ..name = 'John'
  ..age = 25
  ..greet();
```

## 💡 Best Practices

1. **Prefer `final` over `var`** - Immutability is good!
2. **Use named parameters** - Makes code self-documenting
3. **Embrace null safety** - Add `?` when something can be null
4. **Keep functions small** - Each function should do one thing
5. **Use meaningful names** - `userName` not `un`
6. **Comment complex logic** - Explain WHY, not WHAT
7. **Handle errors gracefully** - Always use try-catch for risky operations
8. **Avoid `dynamic`** - Lose type safety, invite bugs
9. **Use `const` constructors** - Better performance in Flutter
10. **Learn async/await** - Synchronous thinking for asynchronous code

## ⚡ Quick Reference

### Variable Declaration
```dart
var name = 'John';              // Type inference
String name = 'John';           // Explicit type
final name = 'John';            // Immutable (runtime)
const pi = 3.14159;             // Immutable (compile-time)
```

### Collections
```dart
List<int> numbers = [1, 2, 3];
Set<String> unique = {'a', 'b'};
Map<String, int> scores = {'Alice': 95};
```

### Functions
```dart
String greet(String name) => 'Hello, $name';
void print({required String message}) { }
```

### Null Safety
```dart
String? nullable;               // Can be null
String nonNull = nullable ?? 'default';
int? length = nullable?.length;
```

### Async
```dart
Future<String> fetchData() async {
  await Future.delayed(Duration(seconds: 1));
  return 'data';
}
```
